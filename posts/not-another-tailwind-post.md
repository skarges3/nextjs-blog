As previously advised, don't listen to me because [I do not know what I think or what I am doing](/posts/hello-world). So for my first foray into this type of webdev writing, I'm gonna cover a modern classic: the Tailwind take.

There are already [too](https://ishadeed.com/article/on-tailwindcss/) [many](https://macarthur.me/posts/why-i-like-tailwind-css) [of](https://dev.to/jaredcwhite/why-tailwind-isn-t-for-me-5c90) [these](https://www.viget.com/articles/what-i-love-hate-about-tailwind-css/) [posts](https://highlandsolutions.com/blog/how-i-quit-worrying-and-learned-to-love-tailwindcss) (and rebuttals, and  rebuttals to the rebuttals) to the point that they have become the "Anyway here's Wonderwall" of dev articles. I'm not sure if there's a lot let to say, but this is a crowded venu you've stopped reading already so, anyway, here's Wonderwall.

## One "framework" to rule them all?

Tailwind is fast becoming the dominant CSS "framework", though I think "framework" is a bit of a misnomer. I think it's really more of a *utility library*. 

> Here are some tiny building blocks

instead of:

> Here are some components that you can reskin

The Tailwind team (or maybe just whoever wrote the copy for their new site) calls it a ["utility-first CSS framework"](https://tailwindcss.com/), but I think that's just a word-of-least-resistance.

In my mind, a "framework" is opinionated to the extent that you stop having to think about composing an interface and skip right to thinking about content and style. As an example, I would expect a framework to have a `.btn` class, while a utility library would force you to compose a `.btn` class or component using utility styles.

One could argue that the preselected colors, spacing units, and shadows that Tailwind creates are constrained enough to warrant using the term "framework", but with `tailwind.config.js` and the new [arbitrary values](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/adding-custom-styles#using-arbitrary-values) feature, we are sort of outside the realm of a framework and really just doing "inline styles on steroids (i.e. media queries and pseudo elements allowed) + some constraints".

## Enough about semantics

JK [semantics are really fun and important actually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YG9WQUfH7ZU). But let's get to what I like I about Tailwind:

In short:
1. [Reducing complexity along the chain](#reducing-complexity-along-the-chain)
2. [Speed of composition](#speed-of-composition)
3. [Performance](#performance)

Let's dive a little deeper:
