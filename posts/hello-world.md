> I write entirely to find out what I'm thinking, what I'm looking at, what I see and what it means. What I want and what I fear.”

— Joan Didion

I want to learn in public. Better yet, I want to fail in public. The only way I can see to do that is to make things for public consumption to find out if others find it useful and engaging.

I have not yet narrowed down what the scope of these posts might be, so to begin with, I might have quite a few odds and ends mixed in. "What are the odds and ends vs. what is the prime rib?" you might ask. Only time will tell. "Will my metaphors become less tortured?" Probably not.

Bon appétit.
