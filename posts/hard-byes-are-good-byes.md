excerpt: 'A note before I go.'

I've had to say goodbye a lot in my life. To friends, to places, to homes, to jobs.

Well maybe I haven't had to say goodbye any more than the average person, but enough to learn something a few times over: one should be grateful when goodbyes are hard, because the alternative is a lot worse.

Today I'm saying goodbye to SMAKK Studios, where I've spent most of my waking hours for the past few years. I have left jobs before where I was just counting down the moments until the last shift was over, but this one is different. I know that's only because of the really great people I've worked, laughed, vented, drank, and karaoked with. Not to mention the awesome and rewarding work we've put out into the world.

Our team helped clients [sell in style](http://truffleco.com), [showcase swag](https://www.creativesolutions.net), and even [honor African American culinary history](https://legacyquiltproject.mofad.org). In two years, my team grew from myself to 4 people. I became a manager for the first time and it made me realize how rewarding it can be to mentor younger folks. 

Like most people, the last few years were pretty tough for me. But being able to work on these projects with these bright, caring, talented people helped me stay sane and grounded (for the most part). I've learned so much from all of them.

In two weeks I'll be starting as a Technical Lead at [Corra](https://corra.com). I'm really excited for a new challenge and a new adventure, but it's hard to say goodbye to SMAKK â€” and for that, I'm grateful.
